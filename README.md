## NOTICE

This repository contains the public FTC SDK for the POWERPLAY (2022-2023) competition season, modified by FTC Team 7247, the H2OLoo Bots, to add some quality of life and modularization.

## Getting Started
If you are new to robotics or new to the *FIRST* Tech Challenge, then you should consider reviewing the [FTC Blocks Tutorial](https://ftc-docs.firstinspires.org/programming_resources/blocks/Blocks-Tutorial.html) to get familiar with how to use the control system:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[FTC Blocks Online Tutorial](https://ftc-docs.firstinspires.org/programming_resources/blocks/Blocks-Tutorial.html)

Even if you are an advanced Java programmer, it is helpful to start with the [FTC Blocks tutorial](https://ftc-docs.firstinspires.org/programming_resources/blocks/Blocks-Tutorial.html), and then migrate to the [OnBot Java Tool](https://ftc-docs.firstinspires.org/programming_resources/onbot_java/OnBot-Java-Tutorial.html) or to [Android Studio](https://ftc-docs.firstinspires.org/programming_resources/android_studio_java/Android-Studio-Tutorial.html) afterwards.

## Getting Help
### User Documentation and Tutorials
*FIRST* maintains online documentation with information and tutorials on how to use the *FIRST* Tech Challenge software and robot control system.  You can access this documentation using the following link:

### Sample OpModes
This project contains a large selection of Sample OpModes (robot code examples) which can be cut and pasted into your /teamcode folder to be used as-is, or modified to suit your team's needs.

Samples Folder: &nbsp;&nbsp; [/FtcRobotController/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/robotcontroller/external/samples](FtcRobotController/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/robotcontroller/external/samples)

The readme.md file located in the [/TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode](TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode) folder contains an explanation of the sample naming convention, and instructions on how to copy them to your own project space.
